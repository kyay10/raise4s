# raise4s
Porting of the Raise DSL from the Arrow Kt Kotlin library

## Dependency

The library is available on Maven Central. To use it, add the following dependency to your `build.sbt` files:

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "in.rcard" % "raise4s_3" % "0.0.2"
```

The library is only available for Scala 3.

## Usage

### The `Raise` DSL in Scala

The Raise DSL is a new way to handle typed errors in Scala. Instead of using a wrapper type to address both the happy path and errors, the `Raise[E]` type describes the possibility that a function can raise a logical error of type `E`. A function that can raise an error of type `E` must execute in a scope that can also handle the error. In recent Scala, it's something that is referred to _direct style_.

The easiest way to define a function that can raise an error of type `E` is to create a context function using the `Raise[E]` the implicit parameter:

```scala 3
case class User(id: String, name: String)

sealed trait Error
case class UserNotFound(id: String) extends Error

def findUserById(id: String): Raise[Error] ?=> User = User(id, "Alice")
```

We can do better than that, using the `infix type raises`:

```scala 3
def findUserById(id: String): User raises Error = User(id, "Alice")
```

How do we read the above syntax? The function `findUserById` returns a `User` and can raise an error of type `String`.

The above function let us short-circuit an execution and raise an error of type `String` using the `raise` function:

```scala 3
def findUserById(id: String): User raises Error =
  if (id == "42") User(id, "Alice") else Raise.raise(UserNotFound(id))
```

The type of error a function can raise is checked at compile time. If we try to raise an error of a different type, the compiler will complain:

```scala 3
def findUserById(id: String): User raises Error =
  if (id == "42") User(id, "Alice") else Raise.raise("User not found")
```

The above code will not compile with the following error:

```
[error] 9 |  if (id == "42") User(id) else Raise.raise("User not found")
[error]   |                                                       ^
[error]   |No given instance of type in.rcard.raise4s.Raise[String] was found for parameter raise of method raise in package in.rcard.raise4s
[error] one error found
```

It's also possible to lift a value to the context `Raise[E] ?=> A`. If we want to lift a value of type `A` to the context `Raise[Nothing]`, we can use the `succeed` function:

```scala 3
def aliceUser: User raises UserNotFound = Raise.succeed(User("42", "Alice"))
```

More useful is to lift a value of type `E` as the error in the context `Raise[E]`:

```scala 3
def userNotFound: User raises UserNotFound = UserNotFound("42").raise[User]
```

We can always rewrite che last function as follows:

```scala 3
def userNotFound: User raises UserNotFound = {
  Raise.raise(UserNotFound("42"))
}
```

We may have noticed that one advantage of using the `Raise[E]` context is that the return type of the function listed only the happy path. As we’ll see in a moment, this is a huge advantage when we want to compose functions that can raise errors.

As you might guess from the previous compiler error, the Raise DSL is using implicit resolutions under the hood. In fact, to execute a function that uses the Raise DSL we need to provide an instance of the `Raise[E]` type class for the error type `E`. The most generic way to execute a function that can raise an error of type `E` and that is defined in the context of a `Raise[E]` is the `fold` function:

```scala 3
Raise.fold(
  block = { findUserById("43") },
  catchBlock = ex => println(s"Error: $ex"),
  recover = error => println(s"User not found: $error"),
  transform = user => println(s"User found: $user")
)
```

Let’s split the above function into parts. The `block` parameter is the function that we want to execute. The `catchBlock` parameter is a function that is executed when the `block` function throws an exception. Don't worry: The lambda handles only `NonFatal` exceptions. The `recover` parameter is a function that is executed when the `block` function raises a logical typed error of type `E`. Finally, the `transform` parameter is a function that is executed when the block function returns a value of type `A`, which is the happy path. All the handling blocks return the exact value of type `B`.

The `fold` function “consumes” the context, creating a concrete instance of a `Raise[E]` type and executing the `block` lambda in the context of that instance.

There are other flavors of the `fold` function. So, please, be sure to check them in the documentation.

Please be aware that any exception thrown inside the `Raise[E]` context will bubble up and not be transformed automatically into a logical typed error. What if we want to convert the exception into a typed error? For example, we want to convert the `IllegalArgumentException` into a `UserNotFound`. Well, we can do it using a function called `catching`:

```scala 3
def findUserByIdWithEx(id: String): User =
  if (id == "42") User(id, "Alice") else throw new IllegalArgumentException(s"User not found with id: $id")

val maybeUser: Either[Error, User] =
  Raise.either:
    Raise.catching[User](() => findUserByIdWithEx("42"), {
      case _: IllegalArgumentException => Raise.raise(UserNotFound("42"))
    })
```

We will see the `either` function in a moment. As we can see, there’s nothing special with the `catching` function. It just catches the exception and calls the catch lambda with the exception. The `catching` function lets the fatal exception bubble up.

It’s a different story if we want to recover or react to a typed error. In this case, we can use the `recover` function:

```scala 3
case class NegativeAmount(amount: Double) extends Error
def convertToUsd(amount: Double, currency: String): Double raises NegativeAmount =
  if (amount < 0) Raise.raise(NegativeAmount(amount))
  else amount * 1.2

val usdAmount: Double =
  Raise.recover({ convertToUsd(-1, "EUR") }, { case NegativeAmount(amount) => 0.0D })
```

### Conversion to Wrapped Types

What if we want to convert a computation in the `Raise[E]` context to a function returning an `Either[E, A]`, a `Try[A]`, an `Option[A]`? Well, nothing is more straightforward than that. 

Let’s start with `Either[E, A]`. The `either` builder is what we're searching for. We can translate the result of the `findUserById` function to an `Either[Error, User]` quite easily:

```scala 3
val maybeUser: Either[Error, User] = 
  Raise.either:
    findUserById("42")
```

If we want to retrieve more information of a user using her name, we can just use the `User` instance directly:

```scala 3
val maybeUserNameInUpperCase: Either[Error, String] = 
  Raise.either:
    val user: User = findUserById("42")
    user.name.toUpperCase
```

Please praise the simplicity and absence of boilerplate code, like calls to `map` functions or when expressions. This is the power of Scala direct style.

It’s also possible to make the backward conversion from an `Either[E, A]` to a `Raise[E]` using the `bind` function:

```scala 3
val userNameInUpperCaseRaiseLambda: Raise[Error] ?=> String = maybeUserNameInUpperCase.bind()
```

The `bind` function is very handful when we need to compose functions that return an `Either[E, A]`:

```scala 3
val one = Right(1)
val two = Right(2)
val three = Raise.either {
  val oneValue = one.bind()
  val twoValue = two.bind()
  oneValue + twoValue
}
```

The `bind` function calls the `raise` function if the `Either` instance is a `Left`; otherwise, it returns the value wrapped by the `Right` instance. Despite the trivial logic implemented in the above example, it's a good example of how to compose functions that return an `Either[E, A]` using the Raise DSL without the use of any `flatMap` function.

We can do the same with `Try[A]` and `Option[A]` using the `asTry` and `option` builders, respectively. Let's start with the `asTry` builder. In this case, the only available type of error is `Throwable`:

```scala 3
val maybeUserWithTry: Try[User] =
  Raise.asTry:
    findUserByIdWithEx("42")
```

As you might guess, any fatal exception thrown inside the `asTry` context will bubble up and not handled.

Last but not least, the `option` builder:

```scala 3
def findUserByIdWithNone(id: String): User raises None.type =
  if (id == "42") User(id, "Alice") else Raise.raise(None)

val maybeUserWithOpt: Option[User] =
  Raise.option:
    findUserByIdWithNone("42")
```

The `bind` function is available for `Try[A]` and `Option[A]` as well.

By the way, there are more feature in the Raise DSL. Please, check the documentation for more information.
